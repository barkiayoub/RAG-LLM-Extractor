GENERAL INFORMATION\\n\\n2022 was a difficult year for the food\\n\\nindustry. After two years of pandem-\\n\\nic crisis, the following year was full of\\n\\nchallenges caused by geopolitical tur-\\n\\nmoil. Russia’s war against Ukraine, the\\n\\naftermath of COVID-19, uncertain ener-\\n\\ngy supplies at record costs,\\n\\nthe highest inflation rate in\\n\\nmany decades and the re-\\n\\nTurnover 2022 2,2 bilion\\n\\ncession in parts of Europe\\n\\nhave hurt many businesses.\\n\\nThe milk market experi-\\n\\nenced\\n\\nan unprecedent-\\n\\nSales 2022 412,500 t\\n\\ned increase in price levels.\\n\\nPackaging material markets were also\\n\\nnegatively affected. Supply chain dis-\\n\\nruptions also posed challenges to pro-\\n\\ncurement across the entire Hochland\\n\\nGroup. Thanks to long-term partner-\\n\\nships with suppliers, the Group has\\n\\nmanaged to reduce the negative im-\\n\\npact on production.\\n\\nThe Hochland Group’s profitability has\\n\\nstabilised in 2022 despite the unpredict-\\n\\nable political and economic situation.\\n\\n20 locations\\n\\nRevenues increased by almost €500 mil-\\n\\nlion, or 29.3%, to €2.2 billion, with this de-\\n\\nvelopment mainly comprising the neces-\\n\\nsary price increases in all markets due to\\n\\nthe dramatic rise in the price of raw ma-\\n\\nterials, packaging materials and energy.\\n\\n4\\n\\nEmployees 5,974\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\nHubert Staub, CFO of Hochland SE,\\n\\nconcludes: „Stable brand business and\\n\\ngrowth in foodservice offset declin-\\n\\ning volumes in the Private Label and\\n\\nCo-Packing areas, resulting in an overall\\n\\nsales increase of 0.6% to 412,500\\n\\ntonnes.” Foreign subsidiaries, pri-\\n\\nmarily Romania, showed satisfac-\\n\\ntory growth in market share, while\\n\\nsales in other Eastern European\\n\\ndomestic companies were stable.\\n\\nThe cheese market in Poland in\\n\\n2022 fared well achieving growth of\\n\\n16.9%. The processed cheese market\\n\\nrepresented 19%, the cream cheese mar-\\n\\nket 15.7%, the hard cheese market 22.9%\\n\\nand the soft cheese market 5%.\\n\\n1. GENERAL INFORMATION\\n\\nHochland Poland defended its position\\n\\nas market leader in the cheese category\\n\\nand turnover increased by almost 20%\\n\\ncompared to the previous year. With\\n\\na share of more than 9% of the Polish\\n\\ncheese market, the Hochland brand\\n\\nwas the best-selling one according to\\n\\nmarket research institute Nielsen.\\n\\nA new product, Almette Cottage\\n\\nCheese, was launched in 2022. This\\n\\nproduct, short-\\n\\nly after its mar-\\n\\nket debut, was\\n\\nawarded\\n\\nthe\\n\\n‘Gold FMCG In-\\n\\nnovation of the\\n\\nYear 2022’\\n\\nin\\n\\nthe\\n\\ninnovative\\n\\nproduct cate-\\n\\ngory. The prod-\\n\\nuct comes in three cheese flavours:\\n\\ncream, skyr and ricotta.\\n\\nIn December 2021, talks conducted with\\n\\nWEGE Siostry, a company creating a\\n\\nwide range of plant-based products,\\n\\nwere finalised. The market for plant-\\n\\nbased alternatives to dairy is develop-\\n\\ning increasingly rapidly in Poland, and\\n\\nconsumers are looking for new products\\n\\nthat are reminiscent of cheese in terms\\n\\nof flavour and properties on the one\\n\\nhand, and contain simple and quality in-\\n\\ngredients on the other. Hochland\\n\\nPoland sees working with\\n\\nWege Siostry company\\n\\nas an opportunity to\\n\\nimplement different\\n\\ntypes of projects in\\n\\nline with Hochland’s\\n\\nstrategy. The brand\\n\\n5\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\nWege Siostry has an innovative approach\\n\\nto producing vegan products and, what\\n\\nHochland finds most important, pays\\n\\nattention to sustainability aspects. After\\n\\nsix years of its presence on the market,\\n\\nthe brand enjoys considerable recogni-\\n\\ntion among those consciously giving up\\n\\nanimal products.\\n\\n“We are committed to inspiring our\\n\\ncustomers and communicating the\\n\\nvalues we hold dear. When working\\n\\non new products, we pay atten-\\n\\ntion to ESG aspects and so-called\\n\\n‘green design’.”\\n\\nMagda Rzymanek-Paczkowska\\n\\ni Zuzanna Rzymanek-Omulecka\\n\\nSource: Raport PlayFair 2022- Archicom\\n\\n2. STRATEGY AND AMBITIONS\\n\\nSustainable development is the only\\n\\nresponsible way to act and respond\\n\\nto rapidly changing market needs. For\\n\\nthe Hochland Group as a whole, it is all\\n\\nabout finding a balance between eco-\\n\\nnomic growth, improving quality of life\\n\\nand caring for the environment. “We\\n\\nare aware of our responsibility as a\\n\\nproduction company. We know that we\\n\\ncan only achieve long-term success if\\n\\nwe act in an environmentally and\\n\\nsocially responsible\\n\\nmanner. We be-\\n\\nlieve that action taken today will have\\n\\na positive impact on the health of our\\n\\nplanet and the future of next genera-\\n\\ntions. Hochland’s extensive pro-en-\\n\\nvironmental activities and the imple-\\n\\nmentation of\\n\\ninnovative measures,\\n\\ninvestments with sustainable develop-\\n\\nment in mind, are a trend setter for the\\n\\nentire industry and define the direction\\n\\n6\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\nin which a mature, conscious business\\n\\nshould go,” emphasises Joanna Ka-\\n\\nmińska, Sustainable Development Man-\\n\\nager at Hochland Polska.\\n\\nEmbedding Sustainable Development\\n\\nin the strategy of Hochland Polska\\n\\nensures that it is a permanent part of\\n\\nthe organisational culture, consistent\\n\\nwith the mission and core values of the\\n\\nentire Hochland Group and with\\n\\nVISION 2025.\\n\\n2.

STRATEGY AND AMBITIONS\\n\\nIn 2022, goals were achieved in terms\\n\\nof increasing renewable energy con-\\n\\nsumption, implementing the sustain-\\n\\nable packaging map, raising awareness\\n\\nof animal welfare among milk suppliers,\\n\\nactively communicating sustainable\\n\\nactions, actions in line with company\\n\\nvalues, supporting charities and local\\n\\ncommunities. Actions that require im-\\n\\nprovement and increased attention in\\n\\nthe next year concern:\\n\\noptimising the use of natural resourc-\\n\\nes such as potable water as part of a\\n\\ncircular economy - investment in new\\n\\nprocess lines has resulted in increased\\n\\nwater consumption during the testing\\n\\nand implementation phase, the actions\\n\\nof the production and technical teams\\n\\nin 2023 will focus on reducing water\\n\\nconsumption and introducing closed-\\n\\nloop circuits.\\n\\ncarbon footprint calculations across\\n\\nthe value chain - a work schedule was\\n\\ndeveloped in 2022 to calculate scope\\n\\n3 CO2 emissions, including the carbon footprint of farms. Livestock contrib-\\n\\nute about six per cent of global green-\\n\\nhouse gas emissions through methane\\n\\nproduced during the feed digestion\\n\\nprocess. Hochland plans to carry out\\n\\nan evaluation of the pilot farms in 2023\\n\\nand then make calculations for the re-\\n\\nmaining farms based on the selected\\n\\ntool.\\n\\nassessment of projects concerning\\n\\nimpact on sustainable development -\\n\\na project assessment sheet based on\\n\\nAccolade software was developed in\\n\\n2022; in the first phase for PD (prod-\\n\\nuct development) projects.

STRATEGY AND AMBITIONS\\n\\n2022 AWARDS\\n\\nHochland Polska was given an award\\n\\nin the ‘Eco-Investor in the Food Indus-\\n\\ntry’ competition, which was took place\\n\\non 19-20 September 2022, in Folwark\\n\\nŁochów, during the Polish Cheese Con-\\n\\ngress, for its investments that have\\n\\nbrought tangible environmental benefits\\n\\nand savings in following areas:\\n\\nelectricity – a total of around 1 million\\n\\nKWh/year;\\n\\nreduction in emissions – more than 350\\n\\ntonnes of CO2;\\n\\na reduction in water consumption –\\n\\nby more than 2,000m3 per year and\\n\\na reduction in the amount of sludge\\n\\ngenerated – by 250 tonnes per year.\\n\\nThe first project is the modernisation of\\n\\nthe wastewater treatment plant by chang-\\n\\ning the technology of the sludge press\\n\\nand generating less waste at the Hoch-\\n\\nland production plant in Kaźmierz. An-\\n\\nother two projects will be implemented\\n\\nat the Hochland plant in Węgrów: optimi-\\n\\nsation of the whey and\\n\\nmilk drying process\\n\\nand automation of the\\n\\ncrystallisers combined\\n\\nwith heat\\n\\nrecovery.\\n\\nCapital\\n\\nexpenditure\\n\\namounted\\n\\nto more\\n\\nthan PLN 3 million.\\n\\nFor the twelfth time,\\n\\n9\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\nthe weekly magazine Polityka, in coop-\\n\\neration with the consulting firm Deloitte\\n\\nand the Responsible Business Forum,\\n\\ninvited companies operating in Poland\\n\\nto take part in the Golden, Silver and\\n\\nWhite Leaf listings. This year, not only\\n\\nwere companies’ sustainable develop-\\n\\nment actions for 2022 were investigated,\\n\\nbut also environmental, social responsi-\\n\\nbility and corporate governance (Envi-\\n\\nronmental, Social and Governance, ESG)\\n\\nactions. Hochland Polska was awarded\\n\\nthe CSR White Leaf. POLITYKA’s CSR\\n\\nWhite Leaf was awarded to companies\\n\\nthat declare the implementation of the\\n\\nmost relevant management categories\\n\\n2. STRATEGY AND AMBITIONS\\n\\n2022 AWARDS\\n\\nrecommended by the ISO 26000 stan-\\n\\ndard (labour practices, including a for-\\n\\nmalised employee appraisal system, an\\n\\nenvironmental impact management sys-\\n\\ntem, social engagement and community\\n\\ndevelopment) and continuously improve\\n\\ntheir operations in this area for the effec-\\n\\ntive management of their company’s im-\\n\\npact on the environment.\\n\\nHochland\\n\\nPolska\\n\\ntook part in the 17th\\n\\nedition of the Re-\\n\\nsponsible Companies Ranking, organ-\\n\\nised by the Kozminski Business Hub at\\n\\nKozminski University. The Responsible\\n\\nCompanies Ranking is a recognised list of\\n\\nthe largest companies in Poland, assessed\\n\\nfor the quality of responsible manage-\\n\\nment in accordance with ESG guidelines.\\n\\nThe ranking is based on the results of\\n\\na survey containing closed-ended ques-\\n\\ntions. The questionnaire constitutes an\\n\\nattachment to the Rules of Procedure.\\n\\nThis year’s survey included 60 questions\\n\\nof a varied nature, in twelve parts derived\\n\\nfrom the already adopted Sustainability\\n\\nReporting Standards (ESRS).\\n\\nThe survey proposes only selected indi-\\n\\ncators that relate to the Sustainability Re-\\n\\nporting Standards (ESRS) adopted by the\\n\\nEuropean Commission as part of EFRAG’s\\n\\noperations. At https://www.efrag.org/you\\n\\ncan get detailed information on reporting\\n\\nrules and ESRS indicators.\\n\\n10\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\nThe Responsible Business Forum, of\\n\\nwhich Hochland Polska is a Partner, has\\n\\nrecognised Hochland Polska in 2022\\n\\nfor its good practices, which were sub-\\n\\nsequently published in the 21st edition\\n\\nof the report “Responsible Business in\\n\\nPoland. Good practices 2022”.\\n\\nThe 21st edition of the Report includ-\\n\\ned 1,705 initiatives implemented by 272\\n\\ncompanies.\\n\\nHochland Polska was recognised for its\\n\\npractices in the following fields:\\n\\nwork (Sherlock Waste app);\\n\\nenvironment – biodiversity and envi-\\n\\nronmental education (Almette protects\\n\\nmeadows – “łąkomaty” (free seed dis-\\n\\npensers), environmental field game, pro-\\n\\nmotion of exemplary pro-environmental\\n\\nattitudes of employees, Environmental\\n\\nDay);\\n\\n2. STRATEGY AND AMBITIONS\\n\\n2022 AWARDS\\n\\nenvironment – eco-efficiency (Digital\\n\\nCleaning);\\n\\nenvironment – circular economy (re-\\n\\nturnable cartons);\\n\\nenvironment – climate (decarbonisation\\n\\nmap and green investments);\\n\\nfair operating practices (the best Milk\\n\\nSupplier contest);\\n\\nsocial engagement and community de-\\n\\nvelopment (Hochland shares all the best\\n\\nit has).\\n\\nGood work practices\\n\\nIn 2022, Hochland launched the Sherlock\\n\\nWaste app at all locations to easily iden-\\n\\ntify fields for possible process improve-\\n\\nments, to eliminate waste, increase OHS\\n\\nlevels and protect the environment. This\\n\\nensures that every employee has a real\\n\\nimpact on improving the tasks they carry\\n\\nout. Through the implementation of the\\n\\napp, Hochland aimed to engage employ-\\n\\nees in a process of continuous improve-\\n\\nment and finding the most effective solu-\\n\\ntions. Since the launch of the programme\\n\\n224 problems and 280 ideas have been\\n\\nreported, and 59 solutions have been\\n\\nimplemented. There are 215 employees\\n\\nregistered in the system. The solutions\\n\\nimplemented should translate into a re-\\n\\nduction in the number and frequency of\\n\\n11\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\naccidents in the future, as well as a reduc-\\n\\ntion in resource consumption, resulting in\\n\\na positive impact on production goals.\\n\\nGood environmental practices\\n\\n1. Hochland teaches the importance of\\n\\nmeadows for the ecosystem through the\\n\\n‘Almette protects meadows’ project. In\\n\\n2022, people were encouraged to sow\\n\\nmeadows in their own gardens and balco-\\n\\nnies and provided with appropriate tools.\\n\\nFree seed dispensers called “łąkomaty”\\n\\nwere set up in Warsaw and Hochland em-\\n\\nployees were given special seed mixes\\n\\nto sow at home themselves. They were\\n\\nalso able to take part in a photo con-\\n\\ntest, with the 12 best entries going into\\n\\nthe company’s calendar. The company\\n\\ncollaborated with the city’s green space\\n\\nmanagement, science communicators\\n\\nand influencers on the project. Hochland’s\\n\\naim was to create a tool that would be\\n\\n2. STRATEGY AND AMBITIONS\\n\\n2022 AWARDS\\n\\nan attractive educational element, in line\\n\\nwith Hochland’s strategy. So far, 72.800m2\\n\\nhave been seeded and two free seed dis-\\n\\npensers were placed in Warsaw. The “Al-\\n\\nmette protects meadows” campaign also\\n\\nfitted in perfectly with the Influencers\\n\\nLive Wrocław event, held under the slo-\\n\\ngan “Creator of the Future”. In addition,\\n\\n850 seed packets were given to Hochland\\n\\nemployees and they were invited to take\\n\\npart in a photo contest. This year’s theme\\n\\nwas supporting the environment by in-\\n\\ncreasing the area of flower meadows.\\n\\n2. Hochland Polska has developed an en-\\n\\nvironmental outdoor game. The project\\n\\ninvolved Hochland’s sustainable devel-\\n\\nopment department and IT employees.\\n\\nThe employees used the above-men-\\n\\ntioned game as part of environmental\\n\\nawareness-raising activities during a fam-\\n\\nily picnic in Kaźmierz for employees and\\n\\ntheir families, and during a world clean-\\n\\nup campaign as an educational element\\n\\nand attraction for pupils from the Prima-\\n\\nry School in Kaźmierz and the Technical\\n\\nSchool Complex in Tarnów Podgórny.\\n\\nPlayers completed the route by searching\\n\\nfor successive QR codes hidden in loca-\\n\\ntions, which were pointed out when the\\n\\ntasks were solved correctly. The ques-\\n\\ntions focused on environmental issues.\\n\\nThis year’s edition focused on resource\\n\\nconservation and biodiversity. So far, 40\\n\\nHochland employees and their families\\n\\nand 50 schoolchildren and their guardians\\n\\nhave taken part in the outdoor game. In-\\n\\ncorporating the game to ‘Clean the World’\\n\\ncontributed to the collection of 8 bags of\\n\\nplastic waste, 7 bags of glass waste and 2\\n\\nbags of paper waste.\\n\\n3. In 2022 Hochland promoted exemplary\\n\\npro-environmental attitudes of employ-\\n\\n12\\n\\nRAPORT ZRÓWNOWAŻONEGO ROZWOJU HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\nees in their daily lives. Staff speakers pre-\\n\\nsented their ecological interests to other\\n\\nemployees and guest local government\\n\\nrepresentatives during the webinar. The\\n\\ncompany also encouraged people to visit\\n\\neco-stands at events organised together\\n\\nwith local authorities and to take part in\\n\\na 3Rs-principle-themed contest.\\n\\nThe webinar was attended by 50 employ-\\n\\nees and 2 representatives of local author-\\n\\nities, and the workshops and classroom\\n\\ndemonstrations in Kaźmierz and Węgrów\\n\\nwere visited by a total of 80 people.\\n\\n4. In 2022 Hochland inaugurated cyclical\\n\\nevents to mark World Environment Day.\\n\\nThe first edition of the campaign took\\n\\nplace in Kaźmierz and Węgrów, where\\n\\nthe production facilities are located, and\\n\\nat the company’s office in Poznań. Each\\n\\nedition aims to raise awareness among\\n\\nemployees and the local community on\\n\\n2. STRATEGY AND AMBITIONS\\n\\n2022 AWARDS\\n\\nenvironmental topics stemming from the\\n\\ncompany’s strategy. The theme for 2022\\n\\nwas water conservation, not wasting food\\n\\nand biodiversity. In addition to the em-\\n\\nployees, representatives of local govern-\\n\\nment, environmental organisations and\\n\\neducation centres were involved. The\\n\\nevent was attended by a total of: 500\\n\\nHochland employees, 6 employees from\\n\\nexternal companies, 200 people from\\n\\nthe local community in Kaźmierz and\\n\\nWęgrów, 2 environmental organisations,\\n\\nas well as 3 representatives from schools\\n\\nand the local government. As a result of\\n\\nthe campaign, more reports of possible\\n\\noptimisations in water consumption were\\n\\nreceived. There has also been a significant\\n\\nrise in waste segregation.\\n\\n5. Hochland has launched a cyclical net-\\n\\nwork drive cleaning event to reduce the\\n\\nCO2 emissions from maintaining data on\\n\\nservers. The Digital Cleaning Days cam-\\n\\npaign was carried out in all Hochland fa-\\n\\ncilities in Poland. Hochland aims to reduce\\n\\nits carbon footprint in every aspect of its\\n\\noperations. Employees from Hochland’s\\n\\nIT and sustainable development and en-\\n\\nvironmental departments were involved\\n\\nin setting up the project, and all employ-\\n\\nees took part. As a result of the measures\\n\\ntaken, the drives gained a total of 33 GB\\n\\nof free space, which is the equivalent of\\n\\n627 kg of CO2.\\n\\n6. Reusable returnable cartons were in-\\n\\ntroduced at the Hochland production fa-\\n\\ncility in Węgrów with the cooperation of\\n\\nthe packaging supplier. The intention is\\n\\na 5-time rotation and reusing of the car-\\n\\ntons in which the empty Almette cups\\n\\nare delivered. Implementing this prac-\\n\\ntice leads to a reduction in the amount\\n\\nof waste generated as well as to reduc-\\n\\n13\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\ntion in the use of raw materials. In 2022,\\n\\nthe intended target of a 5-time rotation\\n\\nwas achieved, resulting in a reduction of\\n\\napproximately 100 tonnes of packaging\\n\\nwaste per year.\\n\\n7. Hochland has developed a decarboni-\\n\\nsation map for its production facilities\\n\\nand is systematically making investments\\n\\nto reduce its carbon footprint, support-\\n\\ning the development of renewable en-\\n\\nergy and a circular economy. Projects\\n\\nresulting from the decarbonisation map\\n\\nare scheduled for implementation by the\\n\\nend of 2025. The project for a wastewa-\\n\\nter sub-treatment plant at the production\\n\\nsite in Węgrów is an example of such ac-\\n\\ntion implemented in 2022. Implementa-\\n\\ntion of the project makes it possible to re-\\n\\nduce the pollutants that are present in the\\n\\nwastewater in undissolved form, which\\n\\nhas a positive impact on the operation of\\n\\n2.

The recovered\\n\\nsludge is transferred to a biogas plant\\n\\nwhere it is used to generate electricity.\\n\\nGood practices in fair operating practices\\n\\nHochland is constantly improving the\\n\\nquality of its cooperation with its stake-\\n\\nholders, including the milk suppliers. The\\n\\ncompany organises the Best Supplier\\n\\nCompetition. In 2022, during the 20th\\n\\nedition of the competition, the company\\n\\nselected the best farmers in five catego-\\n\\nries: “Highest milk quantity”, “Best milk\\n\\nquality”, “Greatest increase in milk quanti-\\n\\nty”, “Animal welfare” and “Environmental-\\n\\nly friendly solutions”. Hochland engages\\n\\nlivestock farmers in actions concerning\\n\\nanimal welfare (goal: 75% of farms in cate-\\n\\ngory A by 2025) and reducing the carbon\\n\\nfootprint of farms (environmental invest-\\n\\nments). The competition selected a farm\\n\\ndistinguished in terms of environmental\\n\\ncare thanks to:\\n\\nusing fertilising crops based on the re-\\n\\nsults of soil sample analyses;\\n\\nutilising energy from photovoltaic instal-\\n\\nlations and solar collectors;\\n\\noperating their own sewage treatment\\n\\nplant;\\n\\nusing heat recovery and hot water\\n\\nto wash equipment.\\n\\nGood practices in the field of social in-\\n\\nvolvement and development of the local\\n\\ncommunity\\n\\nAs part of its “Hochland shares all the best\\n\\nit has” programme, Hochland cooperates\\n\\nwith the Polish Humanitarian Action and\\n\\n14\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\nthe Pajacyk programme to contribute\\n\\nto reducing the problem of child malnu-\\n\\ntrition and its consequences. The logo for\\n\\nthe campaign was placed on the packag-\\n\\ning of Hochland cheeses to let consum-\\n\\ners know that by choosing this product,\\n\\nthey are donating a percentage of the\\n\\nprice to support children in need. In 2022,\\n\\nthe Pajacyk Programme funded 150,000\\n\\nmeals. In the long term a media aware-\\n\\nness campaign was planned, as well as\\n\\ntalks with experts. An educational work-\\n\\nshop for children was held in November.\\n\\nThose wishing to explore the topic of good\\n\\npractice in more depth are invited to visit\\n\\nthe RBF’s Good Practice page:\\n\\n(odpowiedzialnybiznes.pl)\\n\\n3. LEGAL REQUIREMENTS\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS\\n\\nHochland Polska’s facilities have the\\n\\nenvironmental permits required by law,\\n\\nwhich is not just a formality. The envi-\\n\\nronmental permit defines the accept-\\n\\nable manner, extent and paths for the\\n\\nenvironment use. Their aim is to pre-\\n\\nvent pollution of the environment and\\n\\nmake rational use of its resources.\\n\\nAt the Kaźmierz facility, the integrated\\n\\npermit was amended in 2022 with re-\\n\\ngard to:\\n\\nwastewater volumes - a reduction\\n\\nin wastewater volumes related to the\\n\\ndecommissioning of the neighbour-\\n\\ning JANA dairying cooperative plant,\\n\\nwhose sewage system was connected\\n\\nto the Hochland wastewater treatment\\n\\nplant;\\n\\nchanges to the number of emitters\\n\\nupdating and revising the list of sub-\\n\\nstances released to air from the facility\\n\\nand adding information on emergency\\n\\nfuel light oil;\\n\\nan update on the sludge press change.\\n\\nIn Węgrów, due to the introduction of\\n\\na new waste water sub-treatment plant\\n\\nand the consequent appearance of new\\n\\nwaste - traveling screens and sludge\\n\\nfrom the sub-treatment plant, a permit\\n\\nhas been applied for for the production\\n\\nof the aforementioned waste. In Octo-\\n\\nber 2022, the Węgrów Staroste issued\\n\\na decision authorising the production\\n\\nof traveling screens and sludge. The\\n\\nwaste is stored in labelled containers or\\n\\nbins at the sub-treatment plant and is\\n\\nthen transferred to authorised collec-\\n\\ntors.\\n\\nIn 2022, a risk analysis was carried out\\n\\nfor groundwater intakes located in the\\n\\n15\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\narea of the Węgrów and Kaźmierz sites\\n\\nin accordance with Article 133 of the\\n\\nWater Act of 20 July 2017. The analy-\\n\\nsis carried out was aimed at assessing\\n\\nthe geological structure and hydrogeo-\\n\\nlogical conditions on the basis of the\\n\\ndocumentation in terms of risks and\\n\\npossible influences of external factors\\n\\non the quality of the exploited water.\\n\\nThe conclusions of the analysis were\\n\\nto assess the necessity of establishing\\n\\nan intermediate protection zone for the\\n\\ngroundwater intake. Several potential\\n\\nsources that could cause deterioration\\n\\nof groundwater quality have been iden-\\n\\ntified in the resource areas of Węgrów\\n\\nas well as Kaźmierz. However, due to\\n\\nnatural conservation, current land use\\n\\nand development, and the self-purifi-\\n\\ncation capacity of the environment at\\n\\nthis stage, the external company carry-\\n\\n3.

The average Pole is responsible for\\n\\n11 tonnes of CO2eq emissions per year... How does it look in case of Our Employ-\\n\\nees?... the average value is an excellent\\n\\n9.2 tonnes CO2eq. What can be done to reduce the carbon footprint further?\\n\\nOur employees suggest:\\n\\nusing renewable heat sources, such as\\n\\nheat pumps, photovoltaic panels;\\n\\nriding bicycles more often than driving\\n\\n32\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\na car, less time using Internet and avoid-\\n\\ning meat;\\n\\nsaving hot water – shorter baths, lower\\n\\ntemperatures.\\n\\nAn important message of the planned\\n\\nmeetings with Hochland was to draw\\n\\nparticipants’ attention to the fact that\\n\\nmany of the actions taken have a direct\\n\\nimpact on reducing the effects of cli-\\n\\nmate change in Poland.\\n\\n7. WORKING TOWARDS A CIRCULAR ECONOMY\\n\\nHochland Polska knows that reuse is\\n\\none of the most sustainable ways of\\n\\nmanaging items we no longer use and\\n\\nan important part of a circular economy.\\n\\nAmong the actions implementing circu-\\n\\nlar economy principles are:\\n\\nRETURNABLE CARTONS\\n\\nCollaboration with packaging supplier\\n\\nGIZEH Dispoform for a circular economy\\n\\ncontinued in 2022. The intended goal of a\\n\\n5-times rotation of collective cartons for\\n\\nempty Almette cups was achieved. In ad-\\n\\ndition, steps have been initiated to extend\\n\\nthe cooperation to include packaging for\\n\\na further direct packaging.\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\n“Increasingly, slogans that used to adorn only brochures are being transformed into\\n\\nactions for the protection of the environment as well as the sustainable use of natu-\\n\\nral resources.\\n\\nAll ambitious goals and plans require a strong, stable, goal-oriented partner, which\\n\\nis exactly what Hochland Polska Sp. z o.o. is, and it is a pleasure and honour to work\\n\\nwith them. The joint responsibility for circular economy measures was the spearhead\\n\\nfor changing the production system as well as the further ‘life’ of the cartons for both\\n\\nAlmette and Crème products. Collective packagings are being developed not only\\n\\nin relation to the change itself (single-use/multi-use), but also from a technical point\\n\\nof view concerning the origin of the materials, its thickness, strength, etc. Sustain-\\n\\nable packaging is another pillar of joint action. The goals set by HLPL (100% recy-\\n\\nclable product packaging by 2025, 20% reduction of plastic in packaging by 2025)\\n\\nallow packaging to be designed according to circular economy. The introduction\\n\\nof ecodesign principles, covering the entire product life cycle, is one of the key ar-\\n\\neas conditioning the transition to a resource-efficient, low-carbon, sustainable, and\\n\\ncompetitive economy, in which the pro-environmental awareness of producers and\\n\\nconsumers plays an important role. A very good example of eco-design is the Al-\\n\\nmette packaging, the weight of which has been reduced by around 9% while main-\\n\\ntaining all other technical parameters.”\\n\\nArtur Til, International Sales Manager Gizeh Dispoform Sp. z o.o.\\n\\n33\\n\\n7. WORKING TOWARDS A CIRCULAR ECONOMY\\n\\nENERGY FROM SLUDGE\\n\\nHochland Polska focuses on the contin-\\n\\nuous analysis of its processes in search\\n\\nof possible wasteful behaviour and ar-\\n\\neas for improvement. The company is\\n\\naware that the drive to close the loop\\n\\nand the project implemented to this\\n\\nend make a measurable contribution\\n\\nto saving natural resources. Hence the\\n\\ndecision to implement the wastewater\\n\\nsub-treatment plant project.\\n\\nThis project consisted of the construc-\\n\\ntion of a sewage sub-treatment plant\\n\\non the site of a production facility in\\n\\nWęgrów. The technology aims to re-\\n\\nduce the pollutant loads in the indus-\\n\\ntrial waste discharged from the facility\\n\\ninto the municipal sewerage system op-\\n\\nerated within the city of Węgrów and\\n\\nto retain them in undissolved form as\\n\\nsludge. The recovered sludge is then\\n\\ntransferred to a biogas plant, where it is\\n\\nused to generate electricity. Investing in\\n\\nthe production of green energy is part\\n\\nof the company’s strategy, which aims\\n\\nfor a circular and low-carbon economy.\\n\\nThrough this action, the company is\\n\\npursuing several aspects of its strategy:\\n\\nreusing waste and increasing efficien-\\n\\ncy;\\n\\nincreasing the share of green energy\\n\\nin the energy mix;\\n\\nreducing demand for fossil fuels and\\n\\nenergy produced from them;\\n\\nreduction of pollutant emissions, in-\\n\\ncluding CO2.\\n\\nThe company encourages its EMPLOY-\\n\\nEES TO TAKE ACTION TO PROMOTE\\n\\nCE, while educating local communities\\n\\nand supporting charitable causes.

DEVELOPMENT AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION\\n\\nHochland Polska is pursuing a biodiver-\\n\\nsity protection strategy in its operations\\n\\nOne of the activities is the proecological\\n\\nCSR program “Almette protects mead-\\n\\nows”. “Almette protects meadows”\\n\\nin\\n\\n2022, together with the Łąka Founda-\\n\\ntion, we educated, inspired and created\\n\\nnew meadows for another year. We op-\\n\\nerated in one of the Hochland factories in\\n\\nKaźmierz (near Poznań), in Łódź, Warsaw\\n\\nand Wrocław. We also introduced a nov-\\n\\nelty: meadow mats, which were erected\\n\\nin Warsaw and thanks to which everyone\\n\\ncould take a selected seed mixture and\\n\\nsow their own meadow. Thanks to our\\n\\nactions and gourmets, we donated seeds\\n\\nfor sowing 72800 m2 of meadows. Hoch-\\n\\nland employees were also given packages\\n\\nwith a special mixture of seeds of flower\\n\\nmeadows. Meadows are a refuge of biolog-\\n\\nical life, home to millions of pollinators and\\n\\na factor influencing better soil hydration.\\n\\n36\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\nThe project is supported by experts\\n\\nwith their knowledge and experience, in-\\n\\ncluding Prof. Piotr Tryjanowski from the\\n\\nPoznań University of Life Sciences, zool-\\n\\nogist and ecologist, Polish representative\\n\\nin the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\\n\\nChange (IPCC) and Maciej Podyma, grad-\\n\\nuate of the Faculty of Biology of the War-\\n\\nsaw University of Life Sciences, ecologist\\n\\nand president of the Łąka Foundation.\\n\\nIn 2022, on the occasion of International\\n\\nEarth Day, meadow sowing campaigns\\n\\n8. DEVELOPMENT AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\nwere organized at the Kaźmierz produc-\\n\\ntion facility and tree planting campaigns\\n\\nat both sites. In Kaźmierz, a wasteland of\\n\\n5 000m2 was turned into a flower mead-\\n\\now, ensuring that the following environ-\\n\\nmental effects were achieved:\\n\\n(1) Podlewanie raz w tygodniu przez 5 miesięcy. 5 litrów na metr.\\n\\n(2) Koszenie co dwa tygodnie przez 5 miesięcy. Zużycie 0,5 litra na 100 m2 na pojedyncze koszenie.\\n\\n(3) Badanie nad pyłami SGGW i raport Agritech Smogówka\\n\\n(4) Badania Plantlife na 1,2 ha\\n\\n(5) 3 tony C to ok 9 ton CO2\\n\\n“The role of meadow ecosystems has not been sufficiently valued for many decades, and as a result their area has declined\\n\\nsignificantly. This requires action to help restore them and to care for those meadows that still exist. Together with the Al-\\n\\nmette brand, we launched the ‘Almette Protects Meadows’ campaign in Poland. More meadows means a greater variety of\\n\\ninsects, crops, water and clean air. As part of the campaign, the Łąka Foundation is supporting Hochland in raising awareness\\n\\nof the role of meadows for the environment and assisting with other meadow conservation efforts.”.\\n\\nMaciej Podyma, President of the Łąka Foundation\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS IN 2022\\n\\nFrom the beginning of the project to the end of 2022, we donated 72,800m2 of seeds for sowing and set up two free seed dispensers in Warsaw with seeds to collect, for all those who want to join our campaign and sow their own flower meadow.\\n\\n37\\n\\n9. DEVELOPMENT OF THE “HOCHLAND SHARES” CONCEPT\\n\\nHochland Polska is involved in many\\n\\ncharitable initiatives for the benefit of the\\n\\ncommunity, including the local communi-\\n\\nty and the environment.\\n\\n2022 was full of many events, of which\\n\\nHochland Polska was the\\n\\ninitiator,\\n\\nco-organiser or partner.\\n\\nThe company has been supporting the\\n\\nGreat Orchestra of Christmas Charity\\n\\n(WOŚP) for many years, and this time it\\n\\nset up an eSkarbonka and donated bas-\\n\\nkets of delicious cheeses for auction, in-\\n\\ncluding for the WOŚP headquarters in\\n\\nKaźmierz and Szamotuły.\\n\\nOur employees also did not remain in-\\n\\ndifferent to the plight that our Ukrainian\\n\\nneighbours are facing. Hochland also\\n\\njoined in organised aid for Ukrainian refu-\\n\\ngees after the outbreak of war in Ukraine.\\n\\nA team was set up to focus on needs\\n\\nsuch as in-kind assistance, job assistance,\\n\\nadaptation and providing housing. Hoch-\\n\\nland’s actions were carried out in consul-\\n\\ntation with local municipalities.\\n\\nHochland is currently working with the\\n\\nPolish Humanitarian Action and the Pa-\\n\\njacyk programme, contributing to reduc-\\n\\ning the problem of malnutrition among\\n\\n38\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\nthe young and its consequences. The\\n\\nbrand wants to help children most in need\\n\\nby providing them with regular hot meals\\n\\nbut also wants to educate about nutrition\\n\\nand raise awareness of malnutrition.\\n\\nIt is estimated that 410,000 children cur-\\n\\nrently live at the extreme poverty level\\n\\nin Poland. One of the most serious con-\\n\\nsequences is the lack of regular access\\n\\nto food, which often results in the malnu-\\n\\n9. DEVELOPMENT OF THE “HOCHLAND SHARES” CONCEPT\\n\\ntrition of children. This problem has impli-\\n\\ncations for the development of the ner-\\n\\nvous system, affecting stunted growth\\n\\nand puberty, low self-esteem, shame, ex-\\n\\nclusion from the peer group or stigmati-\\n\\nsation.\\n\\nHochland wants to have an impact on\\n\\nbridging the developmental barriers as-\\n\\nsociated with malnutrition, to help un-\\n\\nleash children’s natural potential, to bring\\n\\nback the joy of pursuing passions and\\n\\ndreams by funding hot meals and educa-\\n\\ntion. The logo was placed on the pack-\\n\\naging of the Hochland cheeses to let\\n\\nconsumers know that by choosing the\\n\\nproduct they are making a contribution\\n\\nto supporting children in need. In 2022,\\n\\nthe Pajacyk Programme funded 150,000\\n\\nmeals. In the long term a media aware-\\n\\nness campaign was planned, as well as\\n\\ntalks with experts. An educational work-\\n\\nshop for children was held in November.\\n\\nThere was the joy of playing in the kitch-\\n\\nen and, at the same time, a lot of knowl-\\n\\nedge about how to eat well, having tasty\\n\\nand colourful food.\\n\\nIn 2022, Hochland\\n\\nPolska was once\\n\\nagain a partner of\\n\\nthe Hochland Dolina\\n\\nSamy Half Marathon\\n\\nand the Pyrlandzka\\n\\nDycha 10 kilometre run event. Around\\n\\n400 runners and ‘Nordic walkers’ took\\n\\npart in this 10th anniversary event. After\\n\\nnearly two years of pandemic and runs\\n\\nbeing organised virtually, 2022 saw the\\n\\nreturn of the magnificent running paths\\n\\naround Kaźmierz to, among other places,\\n\\nthe dam at the Radzyny Reservoir.\\n\\n39\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\n10. ASSESSMENT OF SATISFACTION WITH ACTIONS\\n\\nFor the fifth time, a satisfaction survey was\\n\\nconducted among the residents of the\\n\\nKaźmierz and Węgrów municipalities and\\n\\nthe employees of Hochland Polska on the\\n\\nlevel of satisfaction with the company’s\\n\\nactions. As in previous years, respondents\\n\\nanswered questions on support for youth\\n\\neducation, actions taken to promote phys-\\n\\nical activity or the perception of the com-\\n\\npany as environmentally friendly. In the\\n\\nconducted survey, the company was rat-\\n\\ned as exemplary, with an average satis-\\n\\nfaction level of 99% on every question\\n\\nasked.\\n\\nFor Hochland Polska, one of the larg-\\n\\nest local employers in both Kaźmierz and\\n\\nWęgrów, it is important that the local com-\\n\\nmunity is satisfied with such a neighbour.\\n\\nTherefore, as in previous survey editions,\\n\\ncompany employees and all willing people\\n\\nliving near the plant area were invited to\\n\\ncomplete the questionnaire. The results of\\n\\nthe questionnaires allow Hochland Polska\\n\\nto evaluate the effectiveness of its initia-\\n\\ntives and will also help it to choose the best\\n\\nways of working with local communities in\\n\\nthe future.\\n\\nIn 2022, 726 surveys were completed cor-\\n\\nrectly, including 55 by the employees of\\n\\nHochland Polska.\\n\\nThe anonymous survey contained the fol-\\n\\nlowing six questions:\\n\\nQuestion 1: Is Hochland Polska an environ-\\n\\nmentally-friendly company? (survey results\\n\\n99.17%)\\n\\nQuestion 2: Does Hochland Polska support\\n\\nsocially important initiatives? (survey re-\\n\\nsults 99.17%)\\n\\nQuestion 3: Does Hochland Polska support\\n\\nthe education of young people? (survey re-\\n\\nsults 99.17%)\\n\\nQuestion 4: Does Hochland Polska support\\n\\n40\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\ninitiatives that promote physical activity?\\n\\n(survey results 99.04%)\\n\\nQuestion 5: Is Hochland Polska involved in\\n\\nthe development of the commune? (sur-\\n\\nvey results 98.90%)\\n\\nQuestion 6: Overall level of satisfaction\\n\\nwith Hochland Polska initiatives? (survey\\n\\nresults 99.04%).\\n\\nRespondents\\n\\nwere\\n\\nalso asked to provide\\n\\nadditional\\n\\ninforma-\\n\\ntion,\\n\\ni.e.: whether\\n\\nthey live in the mu-\\n\\nnicipality, are regis-\\n\\ntered there, wheth-\\n\\ner they work for\\n\\nHochland Polska\\n\\nand\\n\\ntheir age\\n\\nrange. The com-\\n\\npletion of the survey was re-\\n\\nwarded with a Hochland product to appre-\\n\\nciate the involvement of the respondents.\\n\\n11. BUSINESS COMPATIBILITY\\n\\nHochland’s operation is based on values,\\n\\nthe observance of which is extreme-\\n\\nly important to both the Owners and\\n\\nthe company’s management. In addi-\\n\\ntion to the high quality requirements of\\n\\nour products and services, these values\\n\\nalso include respect for every individ-\\n\\nual, goal-oriented thinking and action\\n\\nby employees, acting with sustainable\\n\\ndevelopment in mind, and the indepen-\\n\\ndence of our company. Respecting and\\n\\npromoting the human rights of our em-\\n\\nployees, as well as those in our supply\\n\\nchains and other contractors, is an im-\\n\\nportant and obvious matter.\\n\\nIn January 2021, a Code of Conduct was\\n\\nissued clarifying the values to which we as\\n\\nHochland want to aspire. This code was\\n\\nalso created to make the requirements\\n\\nfor ethical and legal behaviour more fa-\\n\\nmiliar to our partners and contractors.\\n\\nThe Code contains rules and guidelines\\n\\non:\\n\\nfundamental rules of conduct (reli-\\n\\nability, compliance with laws, mutual re-\\n\\nspect);\\n\\nrelations with contractors and third\\n\\nparties (including granting and accept-\\n\\ning benefits);\\n\\nrelations with employees and social\\n\\npartners (anti-discrimination, freedom\\n\\nof assembly and association);\\n\\nhandling of company property and in-\\n\\nformation.\\n\\nIn December 2021, a specially created\\n\\nTELL US! system was made available\\n\\nto all employees. The system is used\\n\\nto report various types of violations and\\n\\nirregularities that are contrary to our cul-\\n\\nture, business ethics and the Hochland\\n\\nGroup’s principles of management and\\n\\ncooperation. The system is not a substi-\\n\\n41\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\ntute for the standard ‘employee-super-\\n\\nvisor’ communication, which would be\\n\\nused to report violations in the first in-\\n\\nstance.

The company is\\n\\naware that the drive to close the loop\\n\\nand the project implemented to this\\n\\nend make a measurable contribution\\n\\nto saving natural resources. Hence the\\n\\ndecision to implement the wastewater\\n\\nsub-treatment plant project.\\n\\nThis project consisted of the construc-\\n\\ntion of a sewage sub-treatment plant\\n\\non the site of a production facility in\\n\\nWęgrów. The technology aims to re-\\n\\nduce the pollutant loads in the indus-\\n\\ntrial waste discharged from the facility\\n\\ninto the municipal sewerage system op-\\n\\nerated within the city of Węgrów and\\n\\nto retain them in undissolved form as\\n\\nsludge. The recovered sludge is then\\n\\ntransferred to a biogas plant, where it is\\n\\nused to generate electricity. Investing in\\n\\nthe production of green energy is part\\n\\nof the company’s strategy, which aims\\n\\nfor a circular and low-carbon economy.\\n\\nThrough this action, the company is\\n\\npursuing several aspects of its strategy:\\n\\nreusing waste and increasing efficien-\\n\\ncy;\\n\\nincreasing the share of green energy\\n\\nin the energy mix;\\n\\nreducing demand for fossil fuels and\\n\\nenergy produced from them;\\n\\nreduction of pollutant emissions, in-\\n\\ncluding CO2.\\n\\nThe company encourages its EMPLOY-\\n\\nEES TO TAKE ACTION TO PROMOTE\\n\\nCE, while educating local communities\\n\\nand supporting charitable causes.

The theme for 2022\\n\\nwas water conservation, not wasting food\\n\\nand biodiversity. In addition to the em-\\n\\nployees, representatives of local govern-\\n\\nment, environmental organisations and\\n\\neducation centres were involved. The\\n\\nevent was attended by a total of: 500\\n\\nHochland employees, 6 employees from\\n\\nexternal companies, 200 people from\\n\\nthe local community in Kaźmierz and\\n\\nWęgrów, 2 environmental organisations,\\n\\nas well as 3 representatives from schools\\n\\nand the local government. As a result of\\n\\nthe campaign, more reports of possible\\n\\noptimisations in water consumption were\\n\\nreceived. There has also been a significant\\n\\nrise in waste segregation.\\n\\n5. Hochland has launched a cyclical net-\\n\\nwork drive cleaning event to reduce the\\n\\nCO2 emissions from maintaining data on\\n\\nservers. The Digital Cleaning Days cam-\\n\\npaign was carried out in all Hochland fa-\\n\\ncilities in Poland. Hochland aims to reduce\\n\\nits carbon footprint in every aspect of its\\n\\noperations. Employees from Hochland’s\\n\\nIT and sustainable development and en-\\n\\nvironmental departments were involved\\n\\nin setting up the project, and all employ-\\n\\nees took part.

Reusable returnable cartons were in-\\n\\ntroduced at the Hochland production fa-\\n\\ncility in Węgrów with the cooperation of\\n\\nthe packaging supplier. The intention is\\n\\na 5-time rotation and reusing of the car-\\n\\ntons in which the empty Almette cups\\n\\nare delivered. Implementing this prac-\\n\\ntice leads to a reduction in the amount\\n\\nof waste generated as well as to reduc-\\n\\n13\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\ntion in the use of raw materials. In 2022,\\n\\nthe intended target of a 5-time rotation\\n\\nwas achieved, resulting in a reduction of\\n\\napproximately 100 tonnes of packaging\\n\\nwaste per year.\\n\\n7. Hochland has developed a decarboni-\\n\\nsation map for its production facilities\\n\\nand is systematically making investments\\n\\nto reduce its carbon footprint, support-\\n\\ning the development of renewable en-\\n\\nergy and a circular economy. Projects\\n\\nresulting from the decarbonisation map\\n\\nare scheduled for implementation by the\\n\\nend of 2025. The project for a wastewa-\\n\\nter sub-treatment plant at the production\\n\\nsite in Węgrów is an example of such ac-\\n\\ntion implemented in 2022.

WORKING TOWARDS A CIRCULAR ECONOMY\\n\\nENERGY FROM SLUDGE\\n\\nHochland Polska focuses on the contin-\\n\\nuous analysis of its processes in search\\n\\nof possible wasteful behaviour and ar-\\n\\neas for improvement. The company is\\n\\naware that the drive to close the loop\\n\\nand the project implemented to this\\n\\nend make a measurable contribution\\n\\nto saving natural resources. Hence the\\n\\ndecision to implement the wastewater\\n\\nsub-treatment plant project.\\n\\nThis project consisted of the construc-\\n\\ntion of a sewage sub-treatment plant\\n\\non the site of a production facility in\\n\\nWęgrów. The technology aims to re-\\n\\nduce the pollutant loads in the indus-\\n\\ntrial waste discharged from the facility\\n\\ninto the municipal sewerage system op-\\n\\nerated within the city of Węgrów and\\n\\nto retain them in undissolved form as\\n\\nsludge. The recovered sludge is then\\n\\ntransferred to a biogas plant, where it is\\n\\nused to generate electricity. Investing in\\n\\nthe production of green energy is part\\n\\nof the company’s strategy, which aims\\n\\nfor a circular and low-carbon economy.\\n\\nThrough this action, the company is\\n\\npursuing several aspects of its strategy:\\n\\nreusing waste and increasing efficien-\\n\\ncy;\\n\\nincreasing the share of green energy\\n\\nin the energy mix;\\n\\nreducing demand for fossil fuels and\\n\\nenergy produced from them;\\n\\nreduction of pollutant emissions, in-\\n\\ncluding CO2.\\n\\nThe company encourages its EMPLOY-\\n\\nEES TO TAKE ACTION TO PROMOTE\\n\\nCE, while educating local communities\\n\\nand supporting charitable causes.

We op-\\n\\nerated in one of the Hochland factories in\\n\\nKaźmierz (near Poznań), in Łódź, Warsaw\\n\\nand Wrocław. We also introduced a nov-\\n\\nelty: meadow mats, which were erected\\n\\nin Warsaw and thanks to which everyone\\n\\ncould take a selected seed mixture and\\n\\nsow their own meadow. Thanks to our\\n\\nactions and gourmets, we donated seeds\\n\\nfor sowing 72800 m2 of meadows. Hoch-\\n\\nland employees were also given packages\\n\\nwith a special mixture of seeds of flower\\n\\nmeadows.

The theme for 2022\\n\\nwas water conservation, not wasting food\\n\\nand biodiversity. In addition to the em-\\n\\nployees, representatives of local govern-\\n\\nment, environmental organisations and\\n\\neducation centres were involved. The\\n\\nevent was attended by a total of: 500\\n\\nHochland employees, 6 employees from\\n\\nexternal companies, 200 people from\\n\\nthe local community in Kaźmierz and\\n\\nWęgrów, 2 environmental organisations,\\n\\nas well as 3 representatives from schools\\n\\nand the local government. As a result of\\n\\nthe campaign, more reports of possible\\n\\noptimisations in water consumption were\\n\\nreceived. There has also been a significant\\n\\nrise in waste segregation.\\n\\n5. Hochland has launched a cyclical net-\\n\\nwork drive cleaning event to reduce the\\n\\nCO2 emissions from maintaining data on\\n\\nservers. The Digital Cleaning Days cam-\\n\\npaign was carried out in all Hochland fa-\\n\\ncilities in Poland. Hochland aims to reduce\\n\\nits carbon footprint in every aspect of its\\n\\noperations. Employees from Hochland’s\\n\\nIT and sustainable development and en-\\n\\nvironmental departments were involved\\n\\nin setting up the project, and all employ-\\n\\nees took part. As a result of the measures\\n\\ntaken, the drives gained a total of 33 GB\\n\\nof free space, which is the equivalent of\\n\\n627 kg of CO2.\\n\\n6. Reusable returnable cartons were in-\\n\\ntroduced at the Hochland production fa-\\n\\ncility in Węgrów with the cooperation of\\n\\nthe packaging supplier. The intention is\\n\\na 5-time rotation and reusing of the car-\\n\\ntons in which the empty Almette cups\\n\\nare delivered. Implementing this prac-\\n\\ntice leads to a reduction in the amount\\n\\nof waste generated as well as to reduc-\\n\\n13\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\ntion in the use of raw materials. In 2022,\\n\\nthe intended target of a 5-time rotation\\n\\nwas achieved, resulting in a reduction of\\n\\napproximately 100 tonnes of packaging\\n\\nwaste per year.\\n\\n7. Hochland has developed a decarboni-\\n\\nsation map for its production facilities\\n\\nand is systematically making investments\\n\\nto reduce its carbon footprint, support-\\n\\ning the development of renewable en-\\n\\nergy and a circular economy. Projects\\n\\nresulting from the decarbonisation map\\n\\nare scheduled for implementation by the\\n\\nend of 2025. The project for a wastewa-\\n\\nter sub-treatment plant at the production\\n\\nsite in Węgrów is an example of such ac-\\n\\ntion implemented in 2022.

GENERAL INFORMATION\\n\\n2022 was a difficult year for the food\\n\\nindustry. After two years of pandem-\\n\\nic crisis, the following year was full of\\n\\nchallenges caused by geopolitical tur-\\n\\nmoil. Russia’s war against Ukraine, the\\n\\naftermath of COVID-19, uncertain ener-\\n\\ngy supplies at record costs,\\n\\nthe highest inflation rate in\\n\\nmany decades and the re-\\n\\nTurnover 2022 2,2 bilion\\n\\ncession in parts of Europe\\n\\nhave hurt many businesses.\\n\\nThe milk market experi-\\n\\nenced\\n\\nan unprecedent-\\n\\nSales 2022 412,500 t\\n\\ned increase in price levels.\\n\\nPackaging material markets were also\\n\\nnegatively affected.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE “HOCHLAND SHARES” CONCEPT\\n\\nHochland Polska is involved in many\\n\\ncharitable initiatives for the benefit of the\\n\\ncommunity, including the local communi-\\n\\nty and the environment.\\n\\n2022 was full of many events, of which\\n\\nHochland Polska was the\\n\\ninitiator,\\n\\nco-organiser or partner.\\n\\nThe company has been supporting the\\n\\nGreat Orchestra of Christmas Charity\\n\\n(WOŚP) for many years, and this time it\\n\\nset up an eSkarbonka and donated bas-\\n\\nkets of delicious cheeses for auction, in-\\n\\ncluding for the WOŚP headquarters in\\n\\nKaźmierz and Szamotuły.\\n\\nOur employees also did not remain in-\\n\\ndifferent to the plight that our Ukrainian\\n\\nneighbours are facing. Hochland also\\n\\njoined in organised aid for Ukrainian refu-\\n\\ngees after the outbreak of war in Ukraine.\\n\\nA team was set up to focus on needs\\n\\nsuch as in-kind assistance, job assistance,\\n\\nadaptation and providing housing. Hoch-\\n\\nland’s actions were carried out in consul-\\n\\ntation with local municipalities.\\n\\nHochland is currently working with the\\n\\nPolish Humanitarian Action and the Pa-\\n\\njacyk programme, contributing to reduc-\\n\\ning the problem of malnutrition among\\n\\n38\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\nthe young and its consequences. The\\n\\nbrand wants to help children most in need\\n\\nby providing them with regular hot meals\\n\\nbut also wants to educate about nutrition\\n\\nand raise awareness of malnutrition.\\n\\nIt is estimated that 410,000 children cur-\\n\\nrently live at the extreme poverty level\\n\\nin Poland. One of the most serious con-\\n\\nsequences is the lack of regular access\\n\\nto food, which often results in the malnu-\\n\\n9. DEVELOPMENT OF THE “HOCHLAND SHARES” CONCEPT\\n\\ntrition of children. This problem has impli-\\n\\ncations for the development of the ner-\\n\\nvous system, affecting stunted growth\\n\\nand puberty, low self-esteem, shame, ex-\\n\\nclusion from the peer group or stigmati-\\n\\nsation.\\n\\nHochland wants to have an impact on\\n\\nbridging the developmental barriers as-\\n\\nsociated with malnutrition, to help un-\\n\\nleash children’s natural potential, to bring\\n\\nback the joy of pursuing passions and\\n\\ndreams by funding hot meals and educa-\\n\\ntion. The logo was placed on the pack-\\n\\naging of the Hochland cheeses to let\\n\\nconsumers know that by choosing the\\n\\nproduct they are making a contribution\\n\\nto supporting children in need. In 2022,\\n\\nthe Pajacyk Programme funded 150,000\\n\\nmeals. In the long term a media aware-\\n\\nness campaign was planned, as well as\\n\\ntalks with experts.

BUSINESS COMPATIBILITY\\n\\nHochland’s operation is based on values,\\n\\nthe observance of which is extreme-\\n\\nly important to both the Owners and\\n\\nthe company’s management. In addi-\\n\\ntion to the high quality requirements of\\n\\nour products and services, these values\\n\\nalso include respect for every individ-\\n\\nual, goal-oriented thinking and action\\n\\nby employees, acting with sustainable\\n\\ndevelopment in mind, and the indepen-\\n\\ndence of our company. Respecting and\\n\\npromoting the human rights of our em-\\n\\nployees, as well as those in our supply\\n\\nchains and other contractors, is an im-\\n\\nportant and obvious matter.\\n\\nIn January 2021, a Code of Conduct was\\n\\nissued clarifying the values to which we as\\n\\nHochland want to aspire. This code was\\n\\nalso created to make the requirements\\n\\nfor ethical and legal behaviour more fa-\\n\\nmiliar to our partners and contractors.\\n\\nThe Code contains rules and guidelines\\n\\non:\\n\\nfundamental rules of conduct (reli-\\n\\nability, compliance with laws, mutual re-\\n\\nspect);\\n\\nrelations with contractors and third\\n\\nparties (including granting and accept-\\n\\ning benefits);\\n\\nrelations with employees and social\\n\\npartners (anti-discrimination, freedom\\n\\nof assembly and association);\\n\\nhandling of company property and in-\\n\\nformation.\\n\\nIn December 2021, a specially created\\n\\nTELL US! system was made available\\n\\nto all employees. The system is used\\n\\nto report various types of violations and\\n\\nirregularities that are contrary to our cul-\\n\\nture, business ethics and the Hochland\\n\\nGroup’s principles of management and\\n\\ncooperation.

This\\n\\nensures that every employee has a real\\n\\nimpact on improving the tasks they carry\\n\\nout. Through the implementation of the\\n\\napp, Hochland aimed to engage employ-\\n\\nees in a process of continuous improve-\\n\\nment and finding the most effective solu-\\n\\ntions. Since the launch of the programme\\n\\n224 problems and 280 ideas have been\\n\\nreported, and 59 solutions have been\\n\\nimplemented. There are 215 employees\\n\\nregistered in the system.

Hochland teaches the importance of\\n\\nmeadows for the ecosystem through the\\n\\n‘Almette protects meadows’ project. In\\n\\n2022, people were encouraged to sow\\n\\nmeadows in their own gardens and balco-\\n\\nnies and provided with appropriate tools.\\n\\nFree seed dispensers called “łąkomaty”\\n\\nwere set up in Warsaw and Hochland em-\\n\\nployees were given special seed mixes\\n\\nto sow at home themselves. They were\\n\\nalso able to take part in a photo con-\\n\\ntest, with the 12 best entries going into\\n\\nthe company’s calendar. The company\\n\\ncollaborated with the city’s green space\\n\\nmanagement, science communicators\\n\\nand influencers on the project. Hochland’s\\n\\naim was to create a tool that would be\\n\\n2.

So far, 72.800m2\\n\\nhave been seeded and two free seed dis-\\n\\npensers were placed in Warsaw. The “Al-\\n\\nmette protects meadows” campaign also\\n\\nfitted in perfectly with the Influencers\\n\\nLive Wrocław event, held under the slo-\\n\\ngan “Creator of the Future”. In addition,\\n\\n850 seed packets were given to Hochland\\n\\nemployees and they were invited to take\\n\\npart in a photo contest. This year’s theme\\n\\nwas supporting the environment by in-\\n\\ncreasing the area of flower meadows.\\n\\n2. Hochland Polska has developed an en-\\n\\nvironmental outdoor game. The project\\n\\ninvolved Hochland’s sustainable devel-\\n\\nopment department and IT employees.\\n\\nThe employees used the above-men-\\n\\ntioned game as part of environmental\\n\\nawareness-raising activities during a fam-\\n\\nily picnic in Kaźmierz for employees and\\n\\ntheir families, and during a world clean-\\n\\nup campaign as an educational element\\n\\nand attraction for pupils from the Prima-\\n\\nry School in Kaźmierz and the Technical\\n\\nSchool Complex in Tarnów Podgórny.\\n\\nPlayers completed the route by searching\\n\\nfor successive QR codes hidden in loca-\\n\\ntions, which were pointed out when the\\n\\ntasks were solved correctly. The ques-\\n\\ntions focused on environmental issues.\\n\\nThis year’s edition focused on resource\\n\\nconservation and biodiversity. So far, 40\\n\\nHochland employees and their families\\n\\nand 50 schoolchildren and their guardians\\n\\nhave taken part in the outdoor game. In-\\n\\ncorporating the game to ‘Clean the World’\\n\\ncontributed to the collection of 8 bags of\\n\\nplastic waste, 7 bags of glass waste and 2\\n\\nbags of paper waste.\\n\\n3.

We op-\\n\\nerated in one of the Hochland factories in\\n\\nKaźmierz (near Poznań), in Łódź, Warsaw\\n\\nand Wrocław. We also introduced a nov-\\n\\nelty: meadow mats, which were erected\\n\\nin Warsaw and thanks to which everyone\\n\\ncould take a selected seed mixture and\\n\\nsow their own meadow. Thanks to our\\n\\nactions and gourmets, we donated seeds\\n\\nfor sowing 72800 m2 of meadows. Hoch-\\n\\nland employees were also given packages\\n\\nwith a special mixture of seeds of flower\\n\\nmeadows.

The theme for 2022\\n\\nwas water conservation, not wasting food\\n\\nand biodiversity. In addition to the em-\\n\\nployees, representatives of local govern-\\n\\nment, environmental organisations and\\n\\neducation centres were involved. The\\n\\nevent was attended by a total of: 500\\n\\nHochland employees, 6 employees from\\n\\nexternal companies, 200 people from\\n\\nthe local community in Kaźmierz and\\n\\nWęgrów, 2 environmental organisations,\\n\\nas well as 3 representatives from schools\\n\\nand the local government. As a result of\\n\\nthe campaign, more reports of possible\\n\\noptimisations in water consumption were\\n\\nreceived. There has also been a significant\\n\\nrise in waste segregation.\\n\\n5. Hochland has launched a cyclical net-\\n\\nwork drive cleaning event to reduce the\\n\\nCO2 emissions from maintaining data on\\n\\nservers. The Digital Cleaning Days cam-\\n\\npaign was carried out in all Hochland fa-\\n\\ncilities in Poland. Hochland aims to reduce\\n\\nits carbon footprint in every aspect of its\\n\\noperations. Employees from Hochland’s\\n\\nIT and sustainable development and en-\\n\\nvironmental departments were involved\\n\\nin setting up the project, and all employ-\\n\\nees took part. As a result of the measures\\n\\ntaken, the drives gained a total of 33 GB\\n\\nof free space, which is the equivalent of\\n\\n627 kg of CO2.\\n\\n6. Reusable returnable cartons were in-\\n\\ntroduced at the Hochland production fa-\\n\\ncility in Węgrów with the cooperation of\\n\\nthe packaging supplier. The intention is\\n\\na 5-time rotation and reusing of the car-\\n\\ntons in which the empty Almette cups\\n\\nare delivered. Implementing this prac-\\n\\ntice leads to a reduction in the amount\\n\\nof waste generated as well as to reduc-\\n\\n13\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\ntion in the use of raw materials. In 2022,\\n\\nthe intended target of a 5-time rotation\\n\\nwas achieved, resulting in a reduction of\\n\\napproximately 100 tonnes of packaging\\n\\nwaste per year.\\n\\n7. Hochland has developed a decarboni-\\n\\nsation map for its production facilities\\n\\nand is systematically making investments\\n\\nto reduce its carbon footprint, support-\\n\\ning the development of renewable en-\\n\\nergy and a circular economy. Projects\\n\\nresulting from the decarbonisation map\\n\\nare scheduled for implementation by the\\n\\nend of 2025. The project for a wastewa-\\n\\nter sub-treatment plant at the production\\n\\nsite in Węgrów is an example of such ac-\\n\\ntion implemented in 2022.

The\\n\\ncelebration of World Environment Day\\n\\nin Poznań was also a great opportunity\\n\\nto integrate with other companies that\\n\\nmake up the Business Garden in Poznań,\\n\\nand we were delighted to host employ-\\n\\nees of Hochland’s neighbouring compa-\\n\\nnies to join in the joint celebrations.\\n\\n6. RAISING EMPLOYEES’ ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS\\n\\nWe also celebrated Environment Day\\n\\non 18/06/2022 in Węgrów during Hoch-\\n\\nland’s 20th anniversary celebrations.\\n\\nThere were many attractions at the\\n\\nstand, including:\\n\\nA game of pollinator species recogni-\\n\\ntion;\\n\\nPollen and nectar-producing flower\\n\\nbaskets – selecting plants for the garden\\n\\nand balcony to make them attractive\\n\\nto pollinators;\\n\\nEnvironmental quiz with prizes;\\n\\nConstruction of nesting houses for\\n\\nbirds and pollinators;\\n\\nTasting of honey and familiarisation of\\n\\nparticipants with bee products.\\n\\nAt all events, employees calculated and\\n\\nthen shared information about the size\\n\\nof their carbon footprint and how they\\n\\nintend to reduce it.\\n\\nIn calculating our footprint, we learned\\n\\nthat diet, mode of transport, the amount\\n\\nof time spent in front of a laptop screen,\\n\\nclothing and footwear purchased, the\\n\\nchoice of materials things are made of\\n\\n– all have an impact on our carbon foot-\\n\\nprint. The average Pole is responsible for\\n\\n11 tonnes of CO2eq emissions per year... How does it look in case of Our Employ-\\n\\nees?... the average value is an excellent\\n\\n9.2 tonnes CO2eq.

So far, 72.800m2\\n\\nhave been seeded and two free seed dis-\\n\\npensers were placed in Warsaw. The “Al-\\n\\nmette protects meadows” campaign also\\n\\nfitted in perfectly with the Influencers\\n\\nLive Wrocław event, held under the slo-\\n\\ngan “Creator of the Future”. In addition,\\n\\n850 seed packets were given to Hochland\\n\\nemployees and they were invited to take\\n\\npart in a photo contest. This year’s theme\\n\\nwas supporting the environment by in-\\n\\ncreasing the area of flower meadows.\\n\\n2. Hochland Polska has developed an en-\\n\\nvironmental outdoor game. The project\\n\\ninvolved Hochland’s sustainable devel-\\n\\nopment department and IT employees.\\n\\nThe employees used the above-men-\\n\\ntioned game as part of environmental\\n\\nawareness-raising activities during a fam-\\n\\nily picnic in Kaźmierz for employees and\\n\\ntheir families, and during a world clean-\\n\\nup campaign as an educational element\\n\\nand attraction for pupils from the Prima-\\n\\nry School in Kaźmierz and the Technical\\n\\nSchool Complex in Tarnów Podgórny.\\n\\nPlayers completed the route by searching\\n\\nfor successive QR codes hidden in loca-\\n\\ntions, which were pointed out when the\\n\\ntasks were solved correctly.

The theme for 2022\\n\\nwas water conservation, not wasting food\\n\\nand biodiversity. In addition to the em-\\n\\nployees, representatives of local govern-\\n\\nment, environmental organisations and\\n\\neducation centres were involved. The\\n\\nevent was attended by a total of: 500\\n\\nHochland employees, 6 employees from\\n\\nexternal companies, 200 people from\\n\\nthe local community in Kaźmierz and\\n\\nWęgrów, 2 environmental organisations,\\n\\nas well as 3 representatives from schools\\n\\nand the local government. As a result of\\n\\nthe campaign, more reports of possible\\n\\noptimisations in water consumption were\\n\\nreceived. There has also been a significant\\n\\nrise in waste segregation.\\n\\n5. Hochland has launched a cyclical net-\\n\\nwork drive cleaning event to reduce the\\n\\nCO2 emissions from maintaining data on\\n\\nservers. The Digital Cleaning Days cam-\\n\\npaign was carried out in all Hochland fa-\\n\\ncilities in Poland. Hochland aims to reduce\\n\\nits carbon footprint in every aspect of its\\n\\noperations. Employees from Hochland’s\\n\\nIT and sustainable development and en-\\n\\nvironmental departments were involved\\n\\nin setting up the project, and all employ-\\n\\nees took part. As a result of the measures\\n\\ntaken, the drives gained a total of 33 GB\\n\\nof free space, which is the equivalent of\\n\\n627 kg of CO2.\\n\\n6. Reusable returnable cartons were in-\\n\\ntroduced at the Hochland production fa-\\n\\ncility in Węgrów with the cooperation of\\n\\nthe packaging supplier. The intention is\\n\\na 5-time rotation and reusing of the car-\\n\\ntons in which the empty Almette cups\\n\\nare delivered. Implementing this prac-\\n\\ntice leads to a reduction in the amount\\n\\nof waste generated as well as to reduc-\\n\\n13\\n\\nSUSTAINBLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT HOCHLAND POLSKA 2022\\n\\ntion in the use of raw materials. In 2022,\\n\\nthe intended target of a 5-time rotation\\n\\nwas achieved, resulting in a reduction of\\n\\napproximately 100 tonnes of packaging\\n\\nwaste per year.\\n\\n7. Hochland has developed a decarboni-\\n\\nsation map for its production facilities\\n\\nand is systematically making investments\\n\\nto reduce its carbon footprint, support-\\n\\ning the development of renewable en-\\n\\nergy and a circular economy. Projects\\n\\nresulting from the decarbonisation map\\n\\nare scheduled for implementation by the\\n\\nend of 2025. The project for a wastewa-\\n\\nter sub-treatment plant at the production\\n\\nsite in Węgrów is an example of such ac-\\n\\ntion implemented in 2022.
